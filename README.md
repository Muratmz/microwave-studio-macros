Various macros for CST Microwave Studio
=======================================

This project contains some scripts in Visual Basic for Applications which were
useful for me during my PhD research at Voronezh state university. I hope they
can be useful for somebody too.

## Preface

First of all, I'd like to apologise for the language. Visual Basic is a terrible
option, being “for Applications” just makes it worse, not better. Moreover, CST
(at least, version 2012) has a bug which will not allow you to use your own
functions and subroutines freely. I'm very sorry if your eyes are to tear blood
tears, but I really tried to make my code as readable as it possible in that
circumstances.

## Installation

To make use of a script, create a new CST's macro with arbitrary name by using
“Macro → Make VBA Macro...”. Then just replace generated code by copying and
pasting. Don't forget to read a comment at the beginning of the script code
as it may give you some important information.

## Authors

These scripts were developed by me, Pavel Kretov, and provides under the terms
of MIT License. So use can use them mostly as you wish, but I'd very appreciate
if you let me know of any bugs found.
